<h2>About Us</h2>
<p>The Herringbone Society was founded in 2010 by the Shay family to promote and appreciate art, culture, science, and good conversation. At our Haberdashery, you'll find only the best and most stylish apparel for discerning and dapper bohemians. After shopping, show off your new chapeau at our cafe and engage in envigorating debate over our excellent coffee, tea, and pastries. Regular performances every night at 7:30 from a variety of artists and speakers.
